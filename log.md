# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first exercise of Full Stack Open

**Thoughts** This is just the beginning of learning how to use react and developing an understanding of components and props. I found it difficult but I am just getting started so we will see how it goes :)
