# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first exercise of Full Stack Open

**Thoughts** This is just the beginning of learning how to use react and developing an understanding of components and props. I found it difficult but I am just getting started so we will see how it goes :)
