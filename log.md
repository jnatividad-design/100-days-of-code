# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first exercise of Full Stack Open

**Thoughts** This is just the beginning of learning how to use react and developing an understanding of components and props. I found it difficult but I am just getting started so we will see how it goes :)

### Day 2: July 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the exercises 1.3-1.5 of Full Stack Open

**Thoughts** I am still having trouble learning "this" in javascript but I am starting to understand how to use JS objects and working my way to getting comfortable with JS arrays. Only time will tell how far I progress!

### Day 3: July 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished all of the exercises for part 1 of FSO

**Thoughts** I am starting to get comfortable with making components and implementing them within my code and displaying them real time. I still need to practice on my array methods but I'm glad to have finished the exercises.
